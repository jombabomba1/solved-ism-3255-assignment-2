<h3>1-     Modify your answer to ASG01 to use Arrays of string for studentsâ€™ answers and arrays of int for their scores:</h3>

<h3></h3>

<h3>2-     Extend your program to:</h3>

<h3>a.     Compute the score percentage and the letter grade for each student following the grading scheme:</h3>

<h3>A: [90%, 100%], B: [80%, 90%), C: [70%, 80%), F: &lt;70%. Note that B:[80, 90) means a student gets a B if his score is &gt;= 80%, but strictly less than 90%.</h3>

<h3>b.     Compute and display the average score for all students</h3>

<strong> </strong>




<h3>3. Extend your program to get the answers for student number 5 and student number 6 from the user (read from console). Remember the input format for each student is an 11-charcters long string like 5ABACCDEEAD. The user is expected to enter:</h3>

<h3>1. An 11-characters long string starting with student number 5 and ending by enter (return in mac) key</h3>

<h3>2. A second 11-characters long string starting with student number 6 and ending by enter (return in mac) key</h3>
